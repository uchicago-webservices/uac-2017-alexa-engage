Short Skill Description: Fitness skill for adults >= 65


Full Skill Description:
EngAGE Exercise is a fitness skill tailored to adults >= 65 to promote strength, balance, and flexibility. It guides users through a series of daily exercises based on the Go4Life program developed by the National Institute on Aging. Routines change daily (Mon/Wed/Fri, Tues/Thur, Sat/Sun) to target different muscles.

The current version of this skill is a proof of concept to test the feasibility of using an Alexa skill for encouraging adults >= 65 to stay active and to maintain long-term independence. Your feedback is welcome! Future improvements may include customized routines based on personal preferences/needs, a broader scope of exercises, and programs adapted to different skill levels (eg., very low intensity, low intensity, moderate intensity, and high intensity).
